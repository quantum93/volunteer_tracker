# _Volunteer Tracker_

#### _Project for Week 10 at the coding school, Epicodus, written on August 2, 2019._

#### By _**Tae Lee**_

## Description

_Last week, you did a volunteer project for a non-profit. While working on the project, you met the non-profit's IT manager. He's building an internal website to track volunteers working on projects and he'd like your help. Each project should have many volunteers, but a volunteer can only work on one project at a time (a one-to-many relationship). The IT manager has a great deal of experience with SQL so he prefers using SQL for database queries. Fortunately, you know how to integrate raw SQL queries into your application!

The IT manager also believes in testing so he's written the tests himself. You can find the tests here. All tests must be passing. To get one test passing at a time (as usual, you should commit for each passing test), it's recommended to comment out tests you don't need until you're ready to run them.

You may alter a unit test only if you are adding more attributes to volunteers or projects.
You may (and should) add more unit tests if you decide to add additional features or if there are any methods that aren't covered by the included tests.
You may alter the names of buttons and fields in the Capybara tests. You may also add additional tests. However, your integration specs should otherwise use the current provided tests unaltered.
If there is an error or bug in any of the tests, you may correct that error._

* _Clone this repository_
* _Open terminal and type 'git clone [git link]'_
* _Navigate to project directory using cd in terminal_
* _Open project in text editor (atom .)_

* _To run tests, type 'rspec' in terminal_
* _postgres DB installation with sql script in project (if your Postgres DB is not starting at login, please execute "pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start" on terminal._
